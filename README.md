# Inkball

## Overview

### Description
I wrote and published it as an Android game in 2012-2013. I was inspired by the game included in Windows
Vista distributions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InkBall and decided to port it on Android because the natural mechanic
of Inkball makes it much more fun to play on touchscreens instead of on a typical Windows PC using computer mouse.

## Building from source
Building the game from source may be a bit challenging now because it was targeting relatively outdated Android versions.
Yet it's possible. The easiest way is to install Android Studio and follow the standard wizards/procedures to import project,
and then to run on emulator or build APK.
